# ICNotifierHelper
Monitors system-wide android notifications for Instacart batch notifications and ensures a notification sound plays.

The Instacart app rarely plays a sound notification when a new batch comes in and I got sick of it. I want to be able to look at something else besides my phone while waiting for a batch. 
This app is very simple and just monitors system=wide Android notifications from Instacart. When a new batch notification comes in, it plays a notification sound. 
Right now you cant change the default sound, but later I can add a option to change it to whatever you want.
